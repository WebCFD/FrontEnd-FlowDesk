Implementation Plan: Phases 4 & 5
Phase 4: Complete Drag & Drop Integration


4.1 FurnitureDialog Integration
Enable editing STL objects through existing FurnitureDialog system
Add position, rotation, and scale controls for custom objects
Implement dimension editing (width, height, depth)
Add name editing functionality


4.2 Deletion System Integration

Integrate STL objects with existing DelFurn eraser tool (this is already in place)
Ensure proper removal from both scene and furniture store
Add confirmation dialog for custom object deletion (this is better not)


Phase 5: Comprehensive Memory & Store Management
5.1 Store Cleanup Implementation
DelFurn Tool: Remove only scene object + store entry (preserve custom furniture definitions)
Erase Design: Clear entire scene + all furniture store entries + custom furniture definitions
Logout: Complete reset - clear scene + furniture store + custom furniture definitions + user session


5.2 Custom Furniture Store Management
Track custom furniture definitions separately from placed instances
Implement proper cleanup for unused custom furniture types
Ensure custom furniture buttons are removed when appropriate

5.3 Memory Optimization
Implement geometry caching for reused STL objects
Add cleanup for orphaned geometries
Optimize memory usage for multiple custom objects
Specific Actions:
Extend FurnitureDialog for custom objects
Update DelFurn to handle custom furniture deletion
Enhance Erase Design to clear custom furniture definitions
Improve Logout to reset all custom data
Implement geometry caching system
Add cleanup validation to ensure no memory leaks
Store State Management:
Custom furniture definitions (persistent until Erase Design/Logout)
Placed furniture instances (cleared by DelFurn/Erase Design/Logout)
Scene objects (cleared by DelFurn/Erase Design/Logout)
This plan ensures proper separation between custom furniture definitions and their instances, with appropriate cleanup behavior for each action level.
