Implementation Plan: Fix Dialog Cancel Behavior
Problem Analysis
The current implementation uses the same onCancel handler for both creation mode (drag&drop) and edit mode (double-click), causing incorrect deletion behavior when canceling during edit mode.

Solution Architecture
Phase 1: Dialog Mode Detection
Location: Canvas3D.tsx - FurnitureDialog component instantiation
Goal: Add mode tracking to distinguish between creation and edit scenarios

Implementation:

Add isCreationMode boolean flag to FurnitureDialog props
Track creation vs edit mode in the editingFurniture state
Pass mode information when opening the dialog
Phase 2: Enhanced State Management
Location: Canvas3D.tsx - editingFurniture state structure
Goal: Extend state to include mode information

Current Structure:

editingFurniture: {
  index: number;
  item: FurnitureItem;
}
Enhanced Structure:

editingFurniture: {
  index: number;
  item: FurnitureItem;
  mode: 'creation' | 'edit';
}
Phase 3: Conditional Cancel Logic
Location: Canvas3D.tsx - FurnitureDialog onCancel handler
Goal: Implement mode-specific cancel behavior

Logic Flow:

Creation Mode: Execute deletion sequence (current behavior)
Remove from 3D scene
Remove from data store via callback
Close dialog
Edit Mode: Simple dialog closure
Only call setEditingFurniture(null)
No deletion operations
Phase 4: Update Dialog Triggers
Location: Canvas3D.tsx - Multiple trigger points
Goal: Set correct mode when opening dialog

Trigger Points to Update:

Drag&Drop Handler: Set mode to 'creation'
Double-Click Handler: Set mode to 'edit'
useEffect (newFurnitureForDialog): Set mode to 'creation'
Phase 5: FurnitureDialog Interface Update
Location: FurnitureDialog.tsx - Component props interface
Goal: Accept and utilize mode information

Props Addition:

interface FurnitureDialogProps {
  // ... existing props
  isCreationMode?: boolean;
}
Optional Enhancement:

Display mode indicator in dialog header
Adjust button labels based on mode ("Cancel" vs "Close")
Implementation Sequence
First: Update FurnitureDialog props interface
Second: Modify editingFurniture state structure
Third: Update all setEditingFurniture calls to include mode
Fourth: Implement conditional onCancel logic
Fifth: Test both scenarios thoroughly
Testing Strategy
Creation Mode Test:

Drag furniture from menu to canvas
Dialog should open
Click Cancel
Furniture should be deleted (current correct behavior)
Edit Mode Test:

Double-click existing furniture
Dialog should open
Click Cancel
Furniture should remain (currently broken, will be fixed)
Risk Mitigation
Maintain backward compatibility with existing dialog behavior
Ensure real-time updates continue working during edit mode
Preserve all existing furniture manipulation functionality
Add fallback logic for undefined mode scenarios
This plan addresses the root cause while maintaining system stability and existing functionality.
