Implementation Plan for Stair Drawing Tool

Create a new tool mode:

Add a 'stairs' option to the currentTool state alongside 'wall', 'eraser', and 'measure'
Update the corresponding type definitions


Data Structure:

Focus only on a polygon created through sequential point clicks
Add a new state to store stair polygons:

typescriptCopiainterface StairPolygon {
  id: string;
  points: Point[];
  floor: string; // Uses current floor from dropdown
}

Add this to the room store alongside lines, airEntries, and measurements


Drawing Process:

Leverage the existing wall drawing logic but modify it to collect multiple points
Each click adds a new point to the polygon
Display a preview of the shape as it's being built
Allow the user to close the shape by clicking near the starting point
Fill the polygon with a distinct pattern indicating it's a staircase


UI Integration:

Use the existing "Stair Design" button in the Parameters section under multifloor
When clicked, set the current tool to 'stairs' mode
Create the stairs in the currently selected floor from the dropdown menu
No need for a new UI element as the button already exists


Visual Representation:

Design a distinct visual style for the stair polygon:

Use a different color from walls (perhaps a dark orange or brown)
Apply a diagonal line pattern fill
Add a subtle border


Make the polygon semi-transparent to see the grid underneath


Canvas2D Modifications:

Extend the Canvas2D component to handle the stair drawing mode:

Add state to track points in the current polygon
Add logic to handle mouse events for polygon creation
Add rendering logic for both in-progress and completed stair polygons


Adapt the existing mouse handlers to support multi-point collection
Add a mechanism to detect when the polygon is closed
Update the rendering logic to properly display stair polygons



This approach fully integrates with your existing system, using the established UI elements and building on the familiar wall-drawing interaction pattern while adding the specific functionality needed for multi-point polygons.
