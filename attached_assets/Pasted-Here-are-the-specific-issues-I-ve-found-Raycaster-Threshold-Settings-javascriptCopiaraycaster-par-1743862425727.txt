Here are the specific issues I've found:

Raycaster Threshold Settings:
javascriptCopiaraycaster.params.Line.threshold = 5;  
raycaster.params.Points.threshold = 5;
These thresholds might be too large, causing the raycaster to detect intersections even when the cursor is slightly away from the actual element.
Inconsistent Scale Handling:
When an element is highlighted, it's being scaled up by 3x:
javascriptCopiamesh.scale.set(3.0, 3.0, 3.0);
However, when detecting if the cursor has moved away, the code isn't accounting for this increased size properly, leading to a mismatch between the visual representation and the collision detection.
Clearing Previous Highlight Logic:
The code that handles removing the highlight when no intersections are found has a critical bug. It attempts to restore the original material and scale, but there might be timing issues with state updates when setHoveredEraseTarget(null) is called.
Missing Force Render in Some Cases:
After changing object properties like material or scale, the code sometimes doesn't force an immediate render, leading to visual inconsistencies.

I recommend these fixes:

Reduce Raycaster Thresholds:
javascriptCopiaraycaster.params.Line.threshold = 2;  
raycaster.params.Points.threshold = 2;

Improve Scale Handling:
When detecting intersections, account for the scaled size by either:

Adjusting the raycasting against the original unscaled geometry, or
Carefully saving and managing the original and current scales


Add Debug Visualization:
Add temporary debug code that visualizes the actual bounds of the hitbox for elements to see if they match what you expect
Force Render Consistently:
Ensure that after any material or scale change, you call:
javascriptCopianeedsRenderRef.current = true;
if (rendererRef.current && sceneRef.current && cameraRef.current) {
  rendererRef.current.render(sceneRef.current, cameraRef.current);
}


The most likely culprit is the increased scale creating a mismatch between where the cursor appears to be and where the raycaster is actually detecting intersections.
