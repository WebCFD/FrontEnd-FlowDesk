# Quick Database Integration Demo

## Test 1: Authentication Flow Test
**What to do**: 
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Go to Dashboard page
3. Click "Sign In / Register" button
4. Try logging in with:
   - Username: `testuser`
   - Password: `hashedpassword123`
5. Check if dashboard shows 3 simulations from database

**Expected**: Should see real simulations instead of mock data

## Test 2: Post & Analysis Integration Test
**What to do**:
1. After logging in from Test 1
2. Navigate to "Post & Analysis" page
3. Look for "Completed Simulations" section
4. Open the dropdown menu
5. Verify it shows only completed simulations:
   - "Office Building Analysis" (Professional)
   - "Hospital Thermal Comfort" (Enterprise)
6. Should NOT show "Residential HVAC Study" (still processing)

**Expected**: Dropdown filters and shows only completed simulations

## Database Status Check
Current database contains:
- ✅ 5 users total
- ✅ 3 simulations for testuser
- ✅ 2 completed simulations
- ✅ 1 processing simulation
- ✅ Authentication working (401 for unauthorized access)

## If Tests Fail
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify network requests in developer tools
3. Confirm user credentials are correct
4. Check if database connection is active

The database integration is fully functional and ready for testing!
